During this step, you will create an app in AppGallery Connect (AGC) of HUAWEI Developer. When creating the app, you will need to enter the app name, app category, default language, and signing certificate fingerprint. After the app has been created, you will be able to obtain the basic configurations for the app, for example, the app ID and the CPID.

1. Open the command window or terminal and access the bin directory where the JDK is installed.
2. Run the keytool command in the bin directory to view the signature file and run the command.

    ``keytool -list -v -keystore D:\Android\WorkSpcae\HmsDemo\app\HmsDemo.jks``
3. Enter the password of the signature file keystore in the information area. The password is the password used to generate the signature file.
4. Obtain the SHA-256 fingerprint from the result. Save for next step.


#### Add fingerprint certificate to AppGallery Connect
During this step, you will configure the generated SHA-256 fingerprint in AppGallery Connect.

1. In AppGallery Connect, click the app that you have created and go to **Develop> Overview**
2. Go to the App information section and enter the SHA-256 fingerprint that you generated earlier.

It will automaticaly create the GameObject for you and it has DontDestroyOnLoad implemented so you don't need to worry about reference being lost.

Now you need your game to call the Ads Kit Manager from your game. See below for further instructions.
    

## Ads kit
There is a custom editor in Huawei > Kit Settings > Ads tab.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67346749/125590341-618599f5-d88c-4f5a-a126-1117f2fcafea.png)

You can enable/disable ad types that you want in your project.
Insert your Ad Id into these textboxes in the editor.

If you want to use test ads, you can check UseTestAds checkbox that'll overwrite all ad ids with test ads. 

If you want your banner ad shown as soon as application launch you can check Show Banner on Load* checbox.

Then you can call certain functions such as
```csharp
    HMSAdsKitManager.Instance.ShowBannerAd();
    HMSAdsKitManager.Instance.HideBannerAd();
    HMSAdsKitManager.Instance.ShowInterstitialAd();
    
    HMSAdsKitManager.Instance.OnRewarded = OnRewarded;
    HMSAdsKitManager.Instance.ShowRewardedAd();
    
    public void OnRewarded(Reward reward)
    {
       
    }
```
This reference game project's GameManager script can be observed as an example for ads integration
